// The committed bundle must stay inside the oldest browser we support.
//
// This exists because of a real failure. On an Amazon Fire HD 10 (11th gen,
// Fire OS 7 / Android API 30) the dashboard showed "Custom element doesn't
// exist: tinybreeze-card" while every other custom card on the same page
// rendered fine. The module had been fetched; it threw a SyntaxError while
// being evaluated, so customElements.define() never ran and Home Assistant
// fell back to its generic missing-card placeholder. The cause was
// build.mjs targeting es2021, which left 14 `??=`, one `||=` and one `&&=` in
// the output -- syntax that needs Chromium 85.
//
// Why a test and not just a lower target: the bundle is built once and
// committed, so nothing downstream ever re-runs esbuild. A raised target
// ships straight to every installation. CI's `npm run build` +
// `git diff --exit-code` catches a *forgotten* rebuild, but passes happily on
// a *raised target* that was rebuilt and committed -- which is exactly how the
// Fire HD bug would come back.
//
// Why a string scan and not a parse: the CI runner's Node parses ES2021
// happily, so a parser-based check would never fail on its own. The tolerated
// floor is a policy decision, so it is written down here as one rather than
// inferred from whatever the toolchain happens to accept.
//
// The scan assumes minified output (build.mjs sets minify: true), so the
// patterns below carry no spacing variants -- `static{`, never `static {`. If
// minification is ever turned off, these need to become spacing-tolerant.
